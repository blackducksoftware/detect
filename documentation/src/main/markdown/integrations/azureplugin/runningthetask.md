# Running the Task
After you have configured your task, you can run it as follows:

- In Azure DevOps, click **Queue**, and your task is executed on the next available build agent.
- If your task configuration is incomplete, a red status message of "*Some settings need your attention*" displays below **Run [detect_product_short] for your build**. Missing required settings display in red in the **[detect_product_short]** panel.
