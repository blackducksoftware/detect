# Ephemeral Scan

Ephemeral Scan or Ephemeral Scan Mode is a new way of running [solution_name] with Black Duck. This mode is designed to be as fast as possible and does not persist any data on Black Duck. Ephemeral Scan Mode has a unique set of restrictions, mode of configuration and set of results.  It is similar to Rapid Scan Mode however it differs in that it supports usage of the SIGNATURE_SCAN tool.  Ephemeral Scan allows non-persistent signature scans to be performed.

Enable this feature by adding [--detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL](../properties/configuration/blackduck-server.md#detect-scan-mode-advanced) to a run of detect.

## Requirements and Limitations

 * A limited subset of Tools can be run. 
    * The currently supported tools are: DETECTOR, BAZEL, SIGNATURE_SCAN and DOCKER.
    * The EPHEMERAL Signature Scan will not persist on black duck. 
    * All other tools are disabled when running in Ephemeral Scan mode.
 * Ephemeral Scan and non-persistent SIGNATURE_SCAN
    * To perform a non-persistent Signature Scan in Ephemeral mode, SIGNATURE_SCAN must be included within --detect.tools.
    * Permitted tools omitted from the detect.tools list will not be run.
 * Ephemeral Scan requires Black Duck policies. 
    * Ephemeral Scan only reports components that violate policies. 
    * If no policies are violated or there are no defined policies, then no components are returned.
 * Ephemeral Scan does not support ```detect.policy.check.fail.on.severities```
    * [solution_name] will fail with FAILURE_POLICY_VIOLATION if any component violates Black Duck polices with a CRITICAL or BLOCKER severity. 
    * See the Black Duck documentation for a list of policy conditions that are supported by Ephemeral Scan. 
 * Ephemeral Scan does not support ```detect.policy.check.fail.on.names```
 * Ephemeral Scan cannot create a Risk or Notices report.
 * Ephemeral Scan will not create a Project or Version on Black Duck.
 * Ephemeral Scan should be run with aggregation so server-side metrics can be accurately collected.
 * Ephemeral Scan when running SIGNATURE_SCAN requires communication with Black Duck.

 * To invoke Rapid/Ephemeral package manager scans
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID
    * --detect.tools=BAZEL --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID
    * --detect.tools=BAZEL --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DOCKER --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DOCKER --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID
    * --detect.target.type=IMAGE --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID
    * --detect.target.type=IMAGE --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
 * To invoke combined Rapid/Ephemeral scans (non-exhaustive list):
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR,SIGNATURE_SCAN --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR,SIGNATURE_SCAN,DOCKER --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=BAZEL,SIGNATURE_SCAN --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=EPHEMERAL
    * --detect.tools=DETECTOR,DOCKER --detect.blackduck.scan.mode=RAPID

## Configuration

Ephemeral scan policy overrides are the same as for Rapid Scans and can be provided in a file named '.bd-rapid-scan.yaml' in the source directory. The file name must match exactly.

[solution_name] will automatically upload the config file during a rapid scan when present.

The file is a YAML file intended to be checked-in to SCM alongside other build config files.

NOTE: 
 * This file format is dependent on Black Duck and in the future, different versions of Black Duck may require a different file format.
 * This file will have no effect on Signature Scans run in Ephemeral Mode.

```
version: 1.0
policy:
  overrides:
  - policyName: policyA
    components:
    - name: component1
      version: version1
    - name: component2
  - policyName: policyB
    components:
    - name: component3
      version: version3
```

Each policy override must apply to a list of specific components, on a specific version (e.g. component1 + version1) or on all versions (e.g. component2).

## Results

Unlike persistent scans, no data is stored on Black Duck and all scans are done transiently. These scans are primarily intended to be fast, although the SIGNATURE_SCAN can take some time as communication with Black Duck is a requirement.

The results are saved to a json file named 'name_version_BlackDuck_DeveloperMode_Result.json' in the Scan Output directory, where name and version are the project's name and version.

The results are also printed in the logs:

## Ephemeral Scan Compare Mode

You can configure Ephemeral scan to return only the difference in policy violations between the Ephemeral scan and previous intelligent scans using the same configuration. To return only the difference in policy violations, configure detect.blackduck.rapid.compare.mode to BOM_COMPARE or BOM_COMPARE_STRICT.

ALL evaluates all RAPID/EPHEMERAL or FULL policies. BOM_COMPARE_STRICT only shows policy violations not present in an existing project version BOM. BOM_COMPARE depends on the type of
policy rule modes and behaves like ALL if the policy rule is only RAPID but like BOM_COMPARE_STRICT when the policy rule is RAPID and FULL. See the Black Duck documentation for
complete details.
