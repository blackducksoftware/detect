  <note type="hint">To ensure [detect_product_short] correctly identifies the system architecture on ARM-based systems, please install an ARM-specific Java runtime. This is necessary for accurate detection and proper functionality on ARM platforms.</note>

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-3456) BOM components marked as "ignored" will no longer appear in [detect_product_short] risk reports.
* (IDETECT-4781) Signature Scans will no longer fail if SCA Scan Service (SCASS) related IPs are blocked. A performance warning will be printed and a non-SCASS Signature Scan will be performed.
* (IDETECT-4759) Updated [detect_product_short] UV Detector to prevent execution when the `toml` file does not have a `[tool.uv]` section, and to not return a success status unless a BDIO file is generated.
* (IDETECT-4746) Fixed Cargo Lockfile Detector incorrectly labeling transitive dependencies as direct dependencies.
* (IDETECT-4728) Rapid Scans using `BOM_COMPARE_STRICT` now show a clear message if the project version doesnâ€™t exist, guiding users to run a full scan to create it.
* (IDETECT-4736) Gradle Native Inspector no longer appends `+FAILED` suffix to unresolved dependency versions in BDIO output.

### Dependency updates

* Upgraded and released Docker Inspector version 11.5.0.
* Upgraded and released Nuget Inspector version 2.3.0.
* Updated the Black Duck Software BDIO2 protobuf library to version 3.2.12 to resolve a security vulnerability in its Google Protobuf Java library.
