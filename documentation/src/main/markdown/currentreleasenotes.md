* [bd_product_long] [SCA Scan Service (SCASS)](https://community.blackduck.com/s/question/0D5Uh00000O2ZSYKA3/black-duck-sca-new-ip-address-requirements-for-2025) requires customers add or update IP addresses configured in their network firewalls or allow lists.

## Version 10.6.0

### New features

* SCA Scan Service (SCASS) is a scalable solution for performing software composition analysis scans outside of the traditional [bd_product_long] environment. This [detect_product_short] release provides support for SCA Scan Service (SCASS) package manager and signature scans when deployed with [bd_product_short] version 2025.7.0 or later. For further information see [About SCASS](https://documentation.blackduck.com/bundle/bd-hub/page/ComponentDiscovery/aboutScaScanService.html).    
	* To learn more about the IP address configuration requirements for your deployments, refer to the IP notice above.
 
* A new property, [detect.stateless.policy.check.fail.on.severities](properties/basic-properties.html#ariaid-title34) has been added, which will trigger [detect_product_short] to fail the scan and notify the user if a policy violation matches the configured value. This property overrides the default "Blocker" and "Critical" severity settings that cause [detect_product_short] scans to exit. This property applies to both [Rapid](runningdetect/rapidscan.md) and [Stateless](runningdetect/statelessscan.md) scans. Intelligent persistent scans, (when scan mode is not set to RAPID, STATELESS, or [--detect.blackduck.scan.mode](properties/all-properties.html#ariaid-title5) is explicitly set to INTELLIGENT and scan data is persisted), should continue using the [detect.policy.check.fail.on.severities](properties/basic-properties.html#ariaid-title34), property.

* [detect_product_short] will now print the names of fatal policy violations at the [detect_product_short] status stage if [detect.policy.check.fail.on.names](properties/configuration/project.md#fail-on-policy-names-with-violations) is configured. 

* To provide greater control over Cargo dependencies reported in the BOM, a new property, `detect.cargo.dependency.types.excluded` has been added to allow exclusion of specific Cargo dependency types (`DEV`, `BUILD`) from scans. The default behavior (`NONE`) will include all dependency types.

* Node Package Manager (npm) scans now report optional dependencies. The `detect.npm.dependency.types.excluded` property has been extended to exclude optional dependencies if OPTIONAL is specified in the list of arguments.

* [detect_product_long] will now provide an option to generate [bd_product_long] risk report in a parseable (JSON) format. See [Risk Report Generation](results/reports.md) for more details.

* Support for SBT is now extended to 1.11.3.

### Changed features

* To improve processing time when both PNPM and NPM detectors apply to a directory, only PNPM detector will execute, producing the same quality of results.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-4657) - Additional logging has been added for occurances of [detect_product_short] erroring out when loading a malformed Spring Boot config file. 
<note type="hint">A valid Spring Boot config file can be specified via the `--spring.config.location=""` parameter.</note>
* (IDETECT-4700) â€“ Fixed Rapid Scans reporting policy violations from previous full scans when run in BOM_COMPARE or BOM_COMPARE_STRICT mode.

### Dependency updates

* Upgraded and released Detect Docker Inspector version 11.4.0.
