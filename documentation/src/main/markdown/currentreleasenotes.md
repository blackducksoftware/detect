## Version 10.5.0

### New features

* Support for UV Package Manager has been added under [UV Detector](packagemgrs/python.md#uv-package-manager)
* With the `detect.clone.project.version.name` parameter specified and `detect.project.version.update` set to true, [detect_product_short] will now clone, scan, and update the cloned project via parameters such as `detect.project.version.phase`.
* Support for Java 21 has been added.

### Changed features

* Gradle inspector script no longer requires, or includes, Gradle dependencies. This applies to both non-air gap and air gap zip generation.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-4177) - [detect_product_short] no longer requires that the X-Artifactory-Filename header is set when specifying an internally hosted version in [bd_product_long].
* (IDETECT-3512) - To prevent issues when [bd_product_long] and [detect_product_short] disagree on the full list of categories, [detect_product_short] now sends an indicator specifying "all categories" when detect.project.clone.categories is set to ALL.
* (IDETECT-4606) - Support for the exclusion of dependency types in [detect_product_short] Nuget Inspector now includes `project.assets.json` and `project.lock.json` files.
* (IDETECT-4222) – [detect_product_short] now uses `/bom-status/{scanID}` to detect BOM failures and reports them with exit code `FAILURE_BOM_PREPARATION (30)`.
* (IDETECT-4639) – [detect_product_short] now gracefully warns about invalid property keys and suggests corrections, improving usability.

### Dependency updates

* Upgraded and released Nuget Inspector version 2.2.0.
