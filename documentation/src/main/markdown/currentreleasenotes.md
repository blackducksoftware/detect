# Current Release notes

## Version 9.1.0

### New features

* Container Scan. Providing component risk detail analysis for each layer of a container image, (including non-Linux, non-Docker images). Please see [Container Scan ](runningdetect/containerscanning.md) for details.
	<note type="restriction">Your [blackduck_product_name] server must have [blackduck_product_name] Secure Container (BDSC) licensed and enabled.</note>

### Changed features

* For Signature Scans, the directory exclusion argument is no longer passed by default, thus allowing the examination of directory content for matches. Directories can still be excluded from matching by using the 'â€“detect.blackduck.signature.scanner.arguments' property. Please see the [Signature Scanner](properties/configuration/signature-scanner.md#signature-scanner-arguments) property documentation for information on how to specify directories for exclusion.
* Support for Dart is now extended to Dart 3.1.2 and Flutter 3.13.4.
* When [blackduck_product_name] is busy, [solution_name] will now wait the number of seconds specified by [blackduck_product_name] before attempting to retry scan creation.

### Resolved issues
* (IDETECT-4056) Resolved an issue where no components were reported by CPAN detector.
  If the cpan command has not been previously configured and run on the system, [solution_name] instructs CPAN to accept default configurations.
* (IDETECT-3843) Additional information is now provided when [solution_name] fails to update and [solution_name] is internally hosted.

### Dependency updates
* Upgraded [solution_name] Alpine Docker images (standard and buildless) to 3.18 to pull the latest curl version with no known vulnerabilities.
* Removed curl as a dependency from [solution_name] Ubuntu Docker image by using wget instead of curl.
