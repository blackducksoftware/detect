## Version 10.4.0

### New features

* Support for Conda has been extended to 25.1.1.
* Cargo CLI Detector, leveraging `cargo tree` to extract direct and transitive dependencies, improving accuracy over the previous flat lockfile detection. This build-based detector is triggered for Cargo projects with a `Cargo.toml` file and requires Cargo version **1.44.0+**. For further information, see [Cargo package manager support](packagemgrs/cargo.md).
* Added property [detect.cargo.path](properties/detectors/cargo.md) to allow user specification of a custom Cargo executable path.   
* New `detect.pnpm.included.packages` and `detect.pnpm.excluded.packages` properties for pnpm provide increased control over what directories [detect_product_short] scans under a pnpm project. See the [pnpm](properties/detectors/pnpm.html) property page for more information.

### Changed features

* If the URL configured for SCA Scan Service (SCASS) is inaccessible when [detect_product_short] attempts a binary or container scan, [detect_product_short] will retry the scan without using SCASS.
	* See [bd_product_long] SCA Scan Service (SCASS) notice above for information pertaining to IP addresses that require allow listing.

### Resolved issues

* (IDETECT-4642) - Improved handling of pnpm packages that contain detailed version information in the pnpm-lock.yaml. Resolving [detect_product_short] missing some packages through failure to link direct and transitive dependencies. 
* (IDETECT-4641) - Improved [detect_product_short]'s Yarn detector to handle non-standard version entries for component dependencies.
* (IDETECT-4602 & IDETECT-4180) - Resolved Go dependency scan issue that resulted in transitive dependencies assigned to incorrect parent.
* (IDETECT-4594) - Resolved [detect_product_short] failing to handle duplicate keys in `package.json` files across npm, pnpm, Lerna, and Yarn projects.
