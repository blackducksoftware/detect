- Do you want to run [detect_product_short] before you build or after?
- In which directory do you want to run [detect_product_short]?
- Do you want to run [detect_product_short] as a script or a .jar file; this affects which version is run.
- What [tools and detectors](../../components/overview.md) do you want to include or exclude?
- Do you want to run [detect_product_short] offline, or connected to [bd_product_short]?
- Would you like to share scan settings and run autonomous [detect_product_short] scans?
