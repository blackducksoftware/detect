# Including and excluding Tools, Detectors, and Directories

[Properties](../../properties/all-properties.md) provide options for configuring [detect_product_long] behavior. The primary means by which to modify [detect_product_short] output is by including and excluding [tools](../../components/tools.md) and [detectors](../../components/detectors.dita).
