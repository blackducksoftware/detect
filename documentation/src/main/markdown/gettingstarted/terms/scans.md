# Scans and projects

A project is the base unit in [bd_product_long] and [detect_product_long]. A project can be both a stand-alone development project and part of another project. For example, Apache Tomcat is a project but it may also be part of other, larger projects, that make use of its functionality. 

[detect_product_short] scans are mapped to one project. A project version can have more than one scan mapped to it, which enables the mapping of multiple separate folders and their scan results into one aggregated project version.
